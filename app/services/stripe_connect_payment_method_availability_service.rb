# Fetches and caches which payment methods a Stripe Connect (direct-charge) seller's own
# Stripe account can accept, keyed off the account's capabilities.
#
# Why this exists: charges for a direct-charge seller are created on the seller's Stripe
# account, not Gumroad's platform account, and payment method capabilities are per-account.
# Stripe rejects a PaymentIntent create outright when payment_method_types lists a method the
# account hasn't activated — which fails the whole checkout even when the buyer picked a plain
# card (see gumroad-private#1026). So checkout must only offer methods on accounts that
# actually have them. Standard Connect accounts manage their own capabilities (the platform
# cannot request capabilities on the seller's behalf), which is why this is a read-and-cache,
# never a write.
#
# The snapshot stores the account's ENTIRE capabilities hash, not just the capabilities we
# consult today. The mapping from payment method type to required capability happens at read
# time, so launching a new payment method later (SEPA, iDEAL, Klarna, ...) only needs a new
# entry in CAPABILITY_BY_PAYMENT_METHOD_TYPE — every existing snapshot already carries the
# answer, with no re-fetch or invalidation sweep.
