# frozen_string_literal: true

# Builds the presentment snapshot for a client-confirmed checkout paying with a
# method-forced local payment method (iDEAL/Bancontact — methods that can only charge
# in one currency, per Checkout::BuyerCurrencyEligibility::FORCED_CURRENCY_PAYMENT_METHODS).
#
# Unlike the card-path Charge::PresentmentOrchestrator — which runs at charge time and
# replays a quote the buyer already locked at checkout — this runs at intent-*prepare*
# time (Order::PreparePaymentIntentService), before the buyer confirms, because the
# deferred PaymentIntent must be created in the forced currency up front: Stripe rejects
# an iDEAL confirmation against a USD intent.
#
# Two amount-derivation cases, decided by the eligibility service:
#   1. Product already priced in the forced currency (direct listed amount): the buyer
#      is charged the listed price as-is — no FX quote is fetched and the quote columns
#      on the presentment rows stay null by design. Tax/shipping components (computed in
#      USD on the purchase) are converted back using the purchase's own stored
#      rate_converted_to_usd, the same rate that produced those USD figures, so no new
#      FX exposure is introduced.
#   2. Quote-backed checkout: convert the canonical USD charge through the quote the
#      buyer already saw. Mint only for legacy local-method cases that never remounted
#      (iDEAL on a USD listing); a remounted element must reuse its displayed quote.
#
# Returns nil whenever the checkout is ineligible or anything fails, which leaves the
# caller on today's canonical USD behavior. Cleanup of persisted rows when the prepared
# intent later fails/expires is handled by the abandonment step, not here.
