# The single server-issued payment-method list for one checkout page load.
#
# The Payment Element's payment_method_types must equal the deferred PaymentIntent's, or Stripe
# rejects the payment_method_types-scoped ConfirmationToken and the buyer cannot pay with ANY
# method, card included. Both sides used to derive that list independently by re-running
# Checkout::PaymentMethodResolver — the presenter at page load, Order::PreparePaymentIntentService
# at pay time — and two of the resolver's inputs are sampled from different requests:
#
#   * the Klarna amount window, from the mount-time cart total vs. the persisted purchase amounts;
#   * the buyer's country, from the checkout page's own remote_ip vs. the ip_country stamped at
#     order creation (a VPN toggled mid-checkout diverges them with no bug in either path).
#
# Both divergences fail the same way when they fail — the Element holding MORE methods than the
# intent (gumroad-private#1528) — so the list is issued once, signed, and echoed back at prepare
# rather than re-derived: one authority, sampled once.
#
# Signing (rather than trusting a plain parameter) is what keeps the echo from being a way to widen
# past a rollout gate — a client-supplied "us_bank_account" would otherwise re-enable ACH for a
# seller who never opted in (gumroad-private#1143). The payload binds the sellers it was issued
# for, so a token minted on a Klarna-enabled seller's checkout cannot be replayed onto another
# seller's cart.

  # A checkout page older than this re-resolves at prepare exactly as it does today. Long enough to
  # cover a buyer who leaves the tab open through a coffee, short enough that a token cannot outlive
