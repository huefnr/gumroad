    #      pulled, which is exactly what an emergency ramp-down needs to stop.

    #   2. The wallet came from the Payment Element, not the deprecated Payment Request
    #      Button. The element's wallet sheet quotes the locked buyer-currency total the cart
    #      shows (both are mounted from the same FX quote), while the Payment Request Button's
    #      sheet is built from the canonical USD total — charging that buyer in local currency
