  # copy-paste key, the buyer pays in their own banking app, and the intent sits in
  # requires_action until they do (or until the key expires), so a buyer who reopens the return
  # page mid-flow is a normal state rather than a misconfiguration.

  # follow the redirect. It is therefore only treated as expected when the payment method the

  # buy-now-pay-later providers (Klarna, Afterpay/Clearpay, Affirm) and Cash App Pay (whose
  # mobile flow can redirect instead of showing the QR action type above). A retrieved intent
  # whose ATTEMPTED method is one of these can legitimately sit in requires_action +
  # redirect_to_url — e.g. the buyer abandoned iDEAL/Klarna on the provider's site and
  # revisited the return URL — so that combination is expected, not an error.
  # Server-confirmed flows (subscription renewals, off-session charges) only ever create
  # card/mandate intents, so they never carry these methods and keep alerting.

  # its own alipay_handle_redirect type above, depending on the confirm; both are client-owned.

  # would swallow a stray redirect on essentially every US intent, silencing the

  # path whenever the intent merely OFFERED a redirect method alongside card, losing the alert
  # that pages on genuine misconfigurations. When the attempted type is unavailable because
  # nothing is attached yet (or the intent wasn't expanded and carried no ID), fall back to
  # the offered menu so a legitimately-abandoned redirect doesn't page. When the type is
  # unavailable because the LOOKUP FAILED (see PAYMENT_METHOD_LOOKUP_FAILED), keep alerting —
